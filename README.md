# BeautifulSoup-Playground

 This is a test file I use when debugging and testing how to extract elements when writing data scraping scripts.
 
 It's invaluable to be able to not only test things in smaller chunks rather then during runtime, but also saves massive headaches as well.
 
 I hope you find it as useful as I do.
 
 To use the program, simply use the syntax below
 
 ```bash
 python3 -i soup_pg.py https://www.example.com
 ```
